		<p>The world of cryptocurrency is growing with each passing day. With its unique set of benefits, it is attracting investors from around the globe. Are you also looking forward to trading in cryptocurrencies? If yes, then you must read this to know about the different factors associated with it. Trading in cryptocurrencies comes with its advantages and drawbacks. However, it's always good to have some knowledge of the subject beforehand. The crypto market is highly volatile. So, sometimes, you may have to wait patiently or be quick while trading.</p>
		<p>Deciding the best time to invest is apparently the key if you are planning to trade in cryptocurrencies. This is such a crucial aspect and has the potential to maximise your profit with minimum risks. A known strategy could be ‘invest and forget' if an asset you invest in goes down by 20 per cent the very next day. You must wait for it to compensate for the loss.</p>
		<p>Another method to manage entry points is Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) and it works irrespective of what the price of an asset is. So, investors choose to divide their investment options and keep buying assets at regular intervals of time.</p>
		<p>The exit timing is equally crucial. You may grow your portfolio by determining the entry points but exit time is when you realise your profits. An investor must take out profits once a price target is achieved.</p>
